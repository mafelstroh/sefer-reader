===================
Consider this as a simple demonstration of an implmementation of a Laravel instalation, with basic validations and no middleware (due to time restrictions, perhaps).

This project is shipped with a `vagrant`file so it can be easily used using a ready-to-code box such as `Homestead `.

```shell
Vagrant up

-- If vagrant is installed, consider having a LAMP environment to run this example.

1. composer install
2. npm install
3. ~/project_folder php artisan serve
```

Special thanks to scott@deviget.com who gave me the opportunity to actually see my work and take part of his time.
